This segment includes individuals who purchase firearms for personal safety, hunting, target shooting, and other recreational activities. There has been a noticeable increase in firearm ownership among civilians, spurred by growing concerns about personal security and the desire for recreational shooting sports. Firearms such as pistols and rifles are commonly used for self-defense, with a significant portion of civilian consumers opting for compact and easy-to-handle pistols. Additionally, rifles are a popular choice among hunters and sports enthusiasts, especially those involved in long-range shooting or hunting game. The civil application market benefits from the relatively high levels of consumer freedom when it comes to firearm ownership in the U.S., although this is subject to state and federal regulations.<p>In terms of market dynamics, the civil segment has experienced significant growth due to a variety of factors, including social and political shifts, and increased interest in outdoor activities like hunting. Moreover, trends like the rise of the "Second Amendment" movement, which advocates for the right to own and carry firearms, have further fueled the demand for pistols and rifles in the civilian sector.
